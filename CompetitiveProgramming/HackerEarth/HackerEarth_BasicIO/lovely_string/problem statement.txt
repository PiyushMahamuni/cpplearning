Bob's crush's name starts with a vowel. That's the reason Bob loves vowels too much. He calls a string "lovely string" if it contains either all the lowercase vowels or all the uppercase vowels or both, else he calls that string "ugly string". 

For more clarification, see the sample testcase explanation.

Input

Next T lines contain a single string S.

Output
