For this challenge, we want to integrate our own user-defined exception classes
into the Account class hierarchy

The account classes are provided in polymorphism section
Also, the IllegalBalanceException.h files contains the declaration for the
IllegalBalanceException class

What you need to do is-
1. Derive IllegalBalanceException from std::exception and implement the what() method
   to provide an exception message. This exception object should be thrown from the
   Account class constructor when an account object is created with a negative balance.

2. Derive InsufficientFundException from std::exception and implement the what() method
   to provide an exception message. This exception object should be thrown if a
   withdraw results in a negative balance.
   You should throw this object from the Account withdraw method.


-- I'll be modifying files from polymorphism section for this challenge.
