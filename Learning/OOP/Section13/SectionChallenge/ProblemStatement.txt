Section 13 Challenge
=============================================================================

For this challenge you are to develop foundation for a program for movie fanatics that keeps track
of what movies they have watched and how many times they have watched each movie.

The program must support following -
class Movie -  models a movie which includes- 
- Movie Name
- Movie Rating (G, PG, PG-13, R)
- wathced - the number of times the movie has been watched.

class Movies -  models a collection of movie objects

Obviously, Movies need to know about Movie since it's a collection of Movie objects
However, our main driver should only interact with the Movies class.

For example, a simple main should be able to-
- create Movies object
- ask the Movies object to add a movie by providing the movie name, rating, and watched count
- ask the Movies object to increment the watched count by 1 for a movie given its name.
- ask the Movies object to display all of its movies.

Aditionally,
- if we try to add a movie whose name is already in the movie collection we should display this
  error to the user.
- if we try to increment the watched count for a movie whose name is not the movies collection
  we should display this user to the user.
