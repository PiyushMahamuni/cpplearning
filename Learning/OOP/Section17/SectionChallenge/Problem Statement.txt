Create a program that has following

1. A function named make that creates and returns a unique pointer to a vector of shared
pointers to Test objects.

2. A function name fill that expects a vector of shared pointers to test objects and a
int representing the number of test objects to create dynamically and add to the vector

The function will prompt the user to enter an integer, create a shared_ptr to a test
object initialized to the entered integer and add that shared pointer to the vector

3. A function named display that expects a vector of shared_ptr to Test object and display
the data in each test object
