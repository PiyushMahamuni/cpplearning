C style strings - ( Null Terminated Strings)
Declaration - 
char var_name[size]{"string_literal"}
if string literal is provided, size is optional
if string lietral is provided, it should be the case that size >= strlen + 1
1 extra for null character

* In C style string, there has to be the presence of terminating null within
the respective memory location that was reserved for it (strlen + 1)

C style strings can't be reassigned new string values like C++ strings
e.g.
char c_string[]{"This is a c style string"};
c_string = "Re-assignment won't work";
strcpy(c_string, "Other c/C++ string"); // will work
* Note, strcpy won't do bounds checking and might overwrite critical data
since it doesn't know how much memory was originally allocated for c_string
